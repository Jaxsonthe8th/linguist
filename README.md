You control all your data and can download your personal dictionary and other data at any time.

Linguist cares about your traffic and uses a cache. If you translate a page or a phrase once, you can do it again at any time, even without an internet connection. The cache may be disabled if you want to translate private data.

# Why it better than online translation services?

When you use a translation service, you can't translate pages which require authorization, because online services can only translate public pages. Also, online services collect your personal data, track you and give you only one translator, but linguist may use any translation service. It may even use a local translation service that translates your data on your PC without any internet.

# Why it better than other translation extensions?

It's free, open source, [supports all translation services](./docs/CustomTranslator.md) and does not collect your personal data.

This extension allows you to not only translate text on pages, but also translate entered text, keep these important translations for yourself and speak text. It's like your personal translator on the internet.

It is for making life a little more comfortable, for all users of the internet.
